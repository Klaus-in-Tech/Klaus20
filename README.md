### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You are welcome to my world ðŸ‘‹

I am Kakooza Allan Klaus from Uganda in Africa.

I am very passionate about RPA(Robotic Process Automation), got to know about it 2 years ago but am positive it is the career that I'll taking on for the rest of my life since am seeing it's value in real time.

I have a hands on experience with the UiPath platform and I've delivered a number of projects which include Invoicing Bot, Commission Bot, Reconcilation Bot and Extraction Bot using the REFramework for UiPath.

I like learning and upskilling myself with the latest trends in the RPA space.

I also like connecting with people that share the same niche with me.
